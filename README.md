# Extended Essay: Edge Detection
 Images are cool
 Multiple implementations of edge detection for school
 I like school very much :P

 Instructions:
 1. Rename your dataset to image(number).(extension) in increasing order from 0 and store it in the dataset folder
 2. In edgeDetection.py, for each line that contains the word image, change the file extension from .png to your desired one
 3. Run edgeDetection.py and your results should be stored in the other folders

 Note - if you want coloured sobel results, like those in the sobel folder, change the "gray" on line 25 to "image".
